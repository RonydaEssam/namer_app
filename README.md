## 📱 About the Project

This project is an implementation of the official Flutter codelab "[First Flutter App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0)". It's a "random startup name generator that allows users to save their favorites".

**Key Features:**
- Generate random startup names
- Save favorite suggestions
- Navigation between screens

## 🏗️ What I Learned & Practiced

This codelab helped me solidify my understanding of:

### Core Concepts
- **Widget Composition**: Building complex UIs by nesting simple widgets
- **State Management**: Using `setState()` for ephemeral state
- **ListView & Infinite Scroll**: Efficiently displaying lists of data
- **Navigation**: Moving between screens with `Navigator.push()`

### Technical Skills
- **Dart Syntax**: Working with lists, functions, and classes
- **Flutter Widgets**: `ListView.builder`, `Card`, `AppBar`, `FloatingActionButton`
- **Project Structure**: Organizing code in a maintainable way

### Key Takeaways
- How to think in terms of widgets when building UIs
- The importance of separating business logic from UI code
- Practical understanding of Flutter's "everything is a widget" philosophy
